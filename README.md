The goal of the project is to create the frontend part of a web application for TravelTrucks, a company that rents campers. The web application includes several pages, including the home page, catalog page, and individual camper pages with reviews and a booking form.

To implement the functionality of working with camper ads in the front-end application, use the ready-made backend API.
